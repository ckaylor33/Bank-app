# Bank-app

Small banking application - built to show real world use of arrays and solidify array knowledge - HTML, CSS & JavaScript.

Build steps:

1. HTML & CSS
2. Flow chart of functionality
3. User log in - show UI
4. User transfers money
5. User requests loan
6. User closes account - hide UI

Everything has been kept nice and simple, to be able to focus attention on just working with arrays and array best practices. Information that has been overly simplified: accounts, numbers, transactions, etc.

At the same time I wanted the UI to be visually pleasing, meaning an app that I wouldn't mind using myself.
